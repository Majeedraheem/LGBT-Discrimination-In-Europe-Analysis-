## Background

  FRA (fundamental rights agency) conducted an online survey to identify how
  lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people living in the European
  union and Croatia experience the fulfilment of their fundamental rights. the
  evidence produced by the survey will support the development of more effective
  laws and policies to fight discrimination, violence and harassment, improving
  equal treatment across society.

## About the data:

The results reflect the experiences of more than 93,000 individuals who completed the online survey across Europe.
